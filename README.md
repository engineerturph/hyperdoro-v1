//Ilerde jobu deletelemek yerine sadece otomatik timeouta gecme butonu ekle.
//Work bitislerinde bug var duzelt

#Notes

Didn't add pomodoro number modification to settings because i dont think its a good user experience because its too complicated.

Tried to add calculation function in one place but it looks to complicated
